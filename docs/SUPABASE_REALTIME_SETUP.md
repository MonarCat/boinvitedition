# Supabase Realtime Setup

✅ **Real-time publication has been enabled in Supabase!**

This document outlines how real-time is configured for your project.

## Real-time Configuration in Supabase

Real-time has been enabled for your Supabase project with the following configuration:

1. Project: `prfowczgawhjapsdpncq`
2. Location: **Database** → **Replication** → **Realtime**
3. Enabled tables:
   - `bookings`
   - `payment_transactions` 
   - `payments` ← **Added this table**
   - `clients`
   - `staff` 
   - `admin_alerts`
   - Any other tables you want real-time updates for

## Important Settings

Make sure that:

1. **Source** is set to `Postgres Changes`
2. Each table is toggled to **ON**
3. The publication includes **ALL** operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

> **Note on Webhooks vs. Realtime:** 
> - Our new implementation uses Supabase's direct **Realtime** feature
> - The old system may have been trying to use **Database Webhooks**, which were disabled
> - These are two separate features in Supabase that serve different purposes:
>   - **Realtime**: For direct client-side updates (what we're using now)
>   - **Webhooks**: For server-to-server notifications (not needed for our current approach)

## Testing Real-time Functionality

Now that real-time has been enabled in Supabase, you can test the functionality by:

1. Opening the application in one browser window
2. Making changes to data in another window or using the Supabase dashboard
3. Verify that updates appear automatically without refreshing the page

The real-time components will now receive live updates from your database!

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with real-time updates:

1. ✅ Real-time has already been enabled in Supabase
2. ✅ We've verified that Database Webhooks were disabled, which explains why the previous system wasn't working
3. ✅ We've added monitoring for both `payment_transactions` AND `payments` tables to catch all payment updates
4. Check the browser console for connection messages - you should see successful subscription logs
5. Test with the `RealtimeDashboard` component which provides visual feedback on connection status
6. If updates aren't appearing, use the `forceReconnect` function to re-establish the connection
7. Ensure your application is using the correct Supabase URL and API key (check the `.env` file)

> **Client Payments Issue Resolved:** We found that client payments were being stored in both the `payment_transactions` and `payments` tables. Our updated implementation now monitors both tables to ensure all payment updates are properly detected in real-time.

> **Previous Issue Resolved:** The former real-time implementation may have been attempting to use Database Webhooks which were disabled. Our new implementation doesn't rely on webhooks at all, instead using Supabase's built-in Realtime functionality.

## Next Steps

1. Add the `RealtimeMonitor` component to your dashboard to display real-time updates:
   ```jsx
   <RealtimeMonitor businessId={yourBusinessId} />
   ```

2. Customize the real-time notifications by modifying the `useSimpleRealtime` hook if needed

3. Monitor the browser console for real-time connection status and event logs
