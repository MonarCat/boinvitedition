# Boinvit Maintenance Guide

This document provides guidelines for maintaining the Boinvit application, ensuring smooth operation, and keeping the codebase clean and error-free.

## Regular Maintenance Tasks

### 1. Code Quality and Error Prevention

- Run TypeScript type checking regularly: `npm run typecheck`
- Run ESLint to catch code quality issues: `npm run lint`
- Fix any warnings or errors that appear

### 2. Dependency Management

- Keep dependencies up-to-date with `npm outdated` and `npm update`
- Review major version updates carefully before applying them
- Test thoroughly after dependency updates

### 3. Git Workflow

- Use the `sync-boinvit.sh` script for easy pulling, merging, and pushing
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Use feature branches for significant changes

### 4. Testing

- Test new features thoroughly on multiple devices
- Test both online and offline functionality
- Verify PWA features regularly

## Finance Section Maintenance

The Finance section requires special attention as it deals with sensitive payment data:

### Data Security

- Ensure all financial transactions are encrypted
- Implement proper validation for withdrawal requests
- Keep payment account information secure

### Transaction Monitoring

- Regularly check transaction logs for anomalies
- Verify withdrawal processing is working correctly
- Monitor for any failed transactions

### Accounting Accuracy

- Verify that revenue calculations are accurate
- Ensure platform fees are being calculated correctly
- Reconcile available and pending balances

## Common Issues and Solutions

### PWA Update Notifications

The application has been configured to suppress annoying update prompts:

- The `dismissUpdatePrompt.ts` utility handles this behavior
- The `EnhancedPWAManager` component has been positioned to not interfere with UI elements

### Performance Optimization

If the application becomes slow:

- Check for memory leaks with React DevTools
- Optimize renders with useMemo and useCallback
- Consider implementing virtualization for long lists

### API Connection Issues

If the app fails to connect to backend services:

- Verify Supabase connection settings
- Check for CORS issues
- Implement better retry logic

## Emergency Recovery

In case of critical issues:

1. Roll back to the last known good version
2. Notify users through alternate channels
3. Prioritize fixing critical paths (booking and payment)

Remember to keep documentation updated as the application evolves.

## Recent Additions

### Finance Section

The Finance section has been added with the following features:

- Revenue tracking with total, available, and pending balances
