# Connection Issues and Real-time System Improvements

## Overview of Issues

We've addressed several connection-related issues affecting the application:

1. **Datadog Browser SDK Storage Error**:
   ```
   vendor-B2w3_AxV.js:1 Datadog Browser SDK: No storage available for session. We will not send any data.
   ```

2. **Pusher WebSocket Connection Error**:
   ```
   pusher.min.js:8 WebSocket connection to 'wss://ws-eu.pusher.com/app/8e4b9b7â€¦?protocol=7&client=js&version=4.3.1&flash=false' failed: WebSocket is closed before the connection is established.
   ```

3. **Supabase API Error**:
   ```
   prfowczgawhjapsdpncq.supabase.co/rest/v1/payment_transactions:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400 ()
   ```

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Enhanced Browser Storage Handling

We've created a new utility in `src/utils/browserStorage.ts` that:
- Detects storage restrictions in the browser (like private/incognito mode)
- Provides a fallback in-memory storage mechanism
- Monitors storage availability and logs diagnostic information

### 2. Improved WebSocket Connection Management

We've implemented a comprehensive WebSocket connection manager in `src/utils/webSocketManager.ts` that:
- Monitors connection health for Supabase and Pusher
- Provides automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Handles browser online/offline events
- Logs detailed diagnostics for connection issues

### 3. Enhanced Realtime Connection System

We've created a robust `EnhancedRealtimeManager` in `src/services/EnhancedRealtimeManager.ts` that:
- Centralizes all realtime subscriptions
- Implements automatic reconnection with proper error handling
- Provides better diagnostics and monitoring capabilities
- Integrates with React Query for automatic cache invalidation

### 4. DataDog SDK Configuration

We've added specific handling for DataDog in `src/utils/datadogConfig.ts` to:
- Detect when storage is unavailable and provide fallback mechanisms
- Log appropriate warnings when DataDog is expected to fail
- Prevent console errors from affecting user experience

### 5. Improved Query Invalidation

We've updated the query invalidation mechanism to:
- Always include the correct businessId in query keys
- Use retry logic for failed invalidations
- Better handle edge cases like disconnections during invalidation

### 6. Updated React Hooks

We've refactored our hooks to use the enhanced systems:
- Updated `useClientPaymentMonitor` to use the `EnhancedRealtimeManager`
- Made invalidation more robust and business-id specific
- Ensured all relevant queries are invalidated on data changes

### 7. Supabase Connection Initialization

We've centralized Supabase connection initialization in `src/integrations/supabase/connection.ts` to:
- Check connection health on startup
- Register with the enhanced realtime manager
- Set up monitoring and diagnostics
- Configure proper fallbacks for disconnections

## Documentation

We've also added comprehensive documentation:
- `docs/CONNECTION_ISSUES.md`: Explains the issues and solutions
- Added detailed comments in new utility files
- Updated connection-related code with better logging and error messages

## How to Test

To verify the fixes:

1. Test in private/incognito mode to confirm graceful handling of storage limitations
2. Test with network disconnections (turn off WiFi) to verify reconnection behavior
3. Monitor the console for any remaining errors during these scenarios
4. Verify that dashboard stats update correctly when bookings are created

## Further Improvements

Future improvements could include:
- Additional user-facing connection indicators
- More robust offline support for critical operations
- Enhanced monitoring and alerting for connection issues
- Automatic fallback to polling when WebSocket connections fail consistently
