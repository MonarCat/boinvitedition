# Real-time System Pre-Production Checklist

This checklist helps ensure that the real-time functionality is ready for production deployment.

## Database Configuration

- [x] All relevant tables added to Supabase real-time publication:
  - [x] bookings
  - [x] payment_transactions
  - [x] client_business_transactions
  - [x] clients
  - [x] staff
  - [x] staff_attendance
  - [x] admin_alerts
- [x] REPLICA IDENTITY FULL set for all tables to ensure complete data in change events

## Real-time Connection Management

- [x] Connection pooling implemented via RealtimeConnectionManager service
- [x] Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- [x] Network status change detection (online/offline)
- [x] Memory leak prevention through proper cleanup
- [x] Connection status monitoring and visualization
- [ ] Load testing with many concurrent users (TODO)

## User Experience

- [x] Toast notifications for real-time events
- [x] Visual connection status indicator
- [x] Manual reconnection option
- [x] Dashboard invalidation for instant updates
- [ ] Offline mode support for basic functionality (TODO for future)

## Performance Optimization

- [x] Debounced callbacks to prevent excessive reconnection attempts
- [x] Proper cleanup of event listeners and subscriptions
- [x] Query invalidation optimized to minimize refetches
- [ ] Performance monitoring in production (TODO)

## Testing

- [ ] End-to-end testing with multiple browsers/clients
- [ ] Network failure scenario testing
- [ ] Long-running connection stability testing
- [ ] Mobile device testing

## Deployment

- [ ] Environment variables configured for production
- [ ] Error tracking integration (e.g., Sentry)
- [ ] Performance monitoring setup
- [ ] Logging configured for production

## Next Steps for Post-Launch

1. Implement WebSocket fallback mechanism for unreliable connections
2. Add real-time analytics dashboard
3. Implement user presence indicators
4. Consider server-side optimizations for high-traffic scenarios
