# Boinvit Client App Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

The Boinvit Client App ("Boinvit for Booking") is a dedicated mobile application for clients to manage their bookings with businesses using the Boinvit platform. This companion app to our existing "Boinvit for Business" app creates a complete ecosystem that serves both sides of the booking relationship.

4. **Payment Integration**: Streamline payment process for services
5. **Brand Ecosystem**: Strengthen Boinvit brand with a cohesive app ecosystem

4. **No-show Reduction**: % decrease in missed appointments
5. **Rebooking Rate**: % of clients booking again within 30 days
6. **App Store Rating**: Target 4.5+ stars

## Risks and Mitigations
