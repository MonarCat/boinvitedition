# Boinvit Client App - UI/UX Implementation Plan

## UI/UX Vision

The Boinvit client app aims to provide a professional yet friendly user experience that makes booking management effortless for clients. The UI/UX follows these core principles:

1. **Clarity and Simplicity**: Clean layouts with clear visual hierarchy
2. **Contextual Information**: Showing the right information at the right time
3. **Visual Feedback**: Clear status indicators and responsive interactions
4. **Accessibility**: Ensuring the app is usable for everyone
5. **Brand Consistency**: Professional appearance with friendly touches

## Component System

We've established a comprehensive UI component system that includes:

### Core Components

- **Buttons**: Primary, secondary, outline, danger variants with loading states
- **Cards**: For displaying booking information with consistent styling
- **Status Indicators**: Clear visual indicators for booking statuses
- **Empty States**: Friendly, informative screens when no content is available
- **Form Elements**: Consistent styling for inputs, dropdowns, etc.

### Layout Components

- **Screen Layouts**: Consistent padding and structure
- **Headers**: Standardized navigation headers
- **Tab Navigation**: Clear, accessible tab navigation
- **Modal Screens**: For focused tasks like payment, rescheduling

## Screen Flows & Interactions
