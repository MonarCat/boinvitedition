We have made significant progress on the Boinvit client app implementation. Here's a summary of what we've accomplished so far:

- Created navigation structure with MainNavigator, TabNavigator, and AuthNavigator
- Developed initial UI components:
  - Button with multiple variants and states
  - Card for content containers
  - EmptyState for providing user guidance
  - StatusBadge and StatusIndicator for booking status display
  - BookingCard for displaying booking information
- Implemented screens:
  - OnboardingScreen for first-time users
  - LoginScreen for returning users
  - HomeScreen with quick actions and recent content
  - ProfileScreen with user settings
  - BookingsScreen showing upcoming and past bookings
  - BookingDetailsScreen with complete booking information
  - ScannerScreen for QR code functionality
- Created documentation:
  - CLIENT_APP_PLAN.md with overall implementation strategy
  - CLIENT_APP_UIUX_DESIGN.md with design system specifications
  - CLIENT_APP_UIUX_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md for phased implementation
  - CLIENT_APP_UI_IMPLEMENTATION.md with detailed UI/UX approach

## Next Steps

To complete the application according to our UI/UX vision, we need to focus on the following areas:

### 1. Complete Core Screens (1 week)

- [ ] **Registration Screen**: Create the sign-up flow for new users

### 7. Testing & Quality Assurance (1 week)

- [ ] Conduct unit tests for core components
- [ ] Perform integration tests for major flows
- [ ] Test on multiple device sizes
- [ ] Check usability with screen readers
- [ ] Performance profiling and optimization
- [ ] Battery usage monitoring

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### 1. State Management

**Challenge**: Managing complex application state across multiple screens

**Solution**:

- Use React Query for server state
- Context API for authentication and theme
- Local component state for UI interactions

### 2. Form Validation

**Challenge**: Creating consistent form validation across all inputs

**Solution**:

- Create a custom form validation hook
- Standardize error messages and display
- Implement real-time validation where appropriate

### 3. Offline Support

**Challenge**: Providing useful functionality when offline

**Solution**:

- Implement local storage for booking details
- Create clear offline indicators
- Queue actions to perform when back online

### 4. Performance

**Challenge**: Ensuring smooth performance on all devices

**Solution**:

- Lazy load components and screens
- Optimize list rendering with FlatList
- Use image caching and compression
- Minimize JS bridge operations

## Success Metrics

To ensure our implementation meets the project goals, we'll track the following metrics:

1. **User Engagement**:
   - Average session duration > 2 minutes
   - Return rate > 70% for users with active bookings

2. **Task Completion**:
   - Booking view rate > 90%
   - Payment completion rate > 80%
   - Reschedule flow completion > 75%

3. **Performance**:
   - App start time < 2 seconds
   - Screen transition time < 300ms
   - API response handling < 500ms

4. **Satisfaction**:
   - In-app feedback rating > 4/5
   - App store rating target > 4.5/5
