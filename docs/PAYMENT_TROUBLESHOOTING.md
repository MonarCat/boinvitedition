# Payment System Troubleshooting

This document provides solutions for common issues with the payment system.

## Issues and Solutions

### 1. PIN Prompt Appears Before UI is Ready

**Issue**: Clients are prompted for PIN entry before the UI is fully ready, causing confusion.

**Solution**:
- We've added a 1.5-second delay before opening the payment iframe
- Improved loading indicators show that payment is being prepared
- Additional UI feedback during payment initialization

### 2. Payment Status Updates Not Showing

**Issue**: Clients don't always see updates when payment status changes.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced real-time subscriptions to monitor multiple tables
- Added more robust status checking for payments across all relevant tables
- Improved polling mechanism that checks more frequently and provides better feedback
- More specific toast notifications based on payment status

### 3. Mobile Payment Verification Issues

**Issue**: Mobile app payment verification sometimes fails to detect successful payments.

**Solution**:
- Updated verification logic to check multiple database tables
- More robust error handling during verification
- Better feedback during the verification process
- Enhanced logging for troubleshooting

## Debugging Steps

If payment issues persist:

1. **Check Network Connectivity**: Ensure the device has a stable internet connection.

2. **Verify Real-time Connections**: Check WebSocket connections to Supabase for real-time updates.

3. **Multiple Table Verification**: The system now checks payment status across multiple tables:
   - `payments`
   - `payment_transactions`
   - `client_business_transactions`

4. **Manual Refresh**: If automatic updates aren't appearing, refresh the page or app.

5. **Contact Support**: If money was deducted but payment isn't confirmed, contact support with transaction details.

## Technical Implementation

The payment system now includes:

1. **Delayed Payment Initialization**: Added delays before payment UI to ensure everything is ready.

2. **Enhanced Real-time Monitoring**:
   - Multiple Supabase channel subscriptions
   - More comprehensive query invalidation
   - Better error handling and connection status tracking

3. **Improved Payment Polling**:
   - Polls multiple tables for payment status
   - Provides UI feedback during polling
   - More intelligent status detection logic
   - Extended timeout periods for slow payments

4. **Robust Error Handling**:
   - Comprehensive error logging
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Automatic retry mechanisms for transient failures
